Who provides TxTag customer service?
As of Nov. 9, 2024, the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) is processing toll transactions on TxDOT-operated toll roads in the Austin and Houston regions.

Who do I contact regarding toll transactions?
For assistance regarding toll transactions on or after Nov. 9, 2024, customers should contact HCTRA customer service at hctra.org or by calling 281-875-EASY (3279).

TxTag will continue to invoice and collect for transactions that occurred on or before Nov. 8, 2024. If you receive a bill from TxTag for past due tolls, contact the TxTag Call Center or visit the two Austin-area customer service centers to resolve the bill as soon as possible to avoid additional fees and collection notices.

When will HCTRA begin billing and customer services operations for TxTag?
HCTRA will begin performing billing and customer service operations for TxTag starting Dec. 2, 2024.

Do I have to open a new HCTRA account and close my TxTag account?
You may open a new EZ TAG account at any time. However, if your TxTag account is active and in good standing, there is no reason to do so, as the account will automatically transition to HCTRA.

Will I receive a new toll transponder or equipment after the transition?
No, you will use your existing tag after the transition. Customers who need a new or replacement tag sticker after the transition will have to order an EZ TAG.

What will happen to my account balance or prepaid tolls?
If you have a TxTag account and an existing HCTRA account with matching information, your TxTag account will be closed, and the remaining balance refunded. TxTAG will manage all communications regarding closures and refunds.

Will the replenishment amount be adjusted based on increased tag usage?
Rebill rules will match HCTRA’s replenishment policy, which requires a pre-paid deposit of $10 for the first two vehicles and $20 for every two additional vehicles. When the account balance falls at or below $5 or 25% of the minimum required balance, an autocharge will occur.

Will my current TxTag account still work after the transition?
If your account was active and in good standing (meaning you have had transactions in the last 12 months and do not have a balance due), then your TxTag account will be transferred to HCTRA.

Will my current toll transponder or tag continue to work on all roads, or do I have to order a HCTRA tag?
Yes, your current TxTag will continue to work on all toll roads in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Just make sure it is installed in your vehicle, your account details are up to date, and there is enough money in your account for tolls. If you need a new or replacement sticker tag after the transition, you will need to order an EZ TAG.

Will my username and password need to be changed?
Yes, if you would like online access to your new EZ TAG account, you must visit hctra.org’s First Time Login beginning Dec. 2 to set up new username and password.

How will this transition impact toll payment methods (e.g., cash, card, electronic only, go through pay later)?
The primary payment method on the TxTag account will be migrated to the new EZ TAG account. Additionally, customers will be able to pay in cash at our storefront locations or at one of our retailers.

Will there be changes to toll rates or pricing structures?
Toll rates will not be affected on any toll road as a direct result of any transition to HCTRA.

Are there any discounts with HCTRA?
HCTRA offers a 10% toll discount for tagged 2-axle vehicles on HCTRA roadways. Additionally, HCTRA’s Veteran Discount Tolling program provides free tolls for eligible license plates on all HCTRA and TxDOT roadways, except for SH130 Segments 5 (from north of Mustang Ridge to FM 1185 north of Lockhart) and 6 (from FM 1185 to I-10 northeast of Seguin). For more information about the program, visit our HCTRA FAQs page (Topic: Veteran Discount Tolling).

Will my TxTag transaction history transfer over to the new EZ TAG system?
HCTRA will have limited access to your TxTag history, but we will still be able to assist you with your transitioned account.

Will I still be able to use my toll account when traveling to other states, that are listed for HCTRA and TxTag? How will this transition affect the tolls I pay on different highways or regions?
Yes, you will be able to continue using your existing TxTag (or new EZ TAG) to pay tolls on all toll roads in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Toll rates will not be affected as a direct result of any transition to HCTRA.

Will the motorcycle and license plate tags have a fee?
Yes, HCTRA hard case tags have an initial fee of $15 for the first three tags and $10 each thereafter.

Will customer service contact information change? Will there be any changes to the mobile app or online portal? Will TxTAG customers use the HCTRA website for account maintenance?
Customers will use the HCTRA website, customer service phone line, and mobile application as follows:
Website: www.hctra.org
Phone: 281-875-EASY (3279)
Mobile App: Download EZ TAG app in App Store or Google Play

Will the hours of operation for customer service change?

Will past due invoices for TxTag go to HCTRA collection’s agency?
Any past due invoices for transactions occurring before the transition period will remain with TxTag and escalate according to TxDOT rules. To make a payment on past due invoices please contact TxTag at 1-888-468-9824.

Will there be new toll roads or expansions because of the transition?
There are no current plans for adding toll roads as a result of the transition.

Will my statement cycle change?
