    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Who provides TxTag customer service?
        answer: |
          As of Nov. 9, 2024, the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) is processing toll transactions on
          TxDOT-operated toll roads in the Austin and Houston regions.
      - question: |
          Who do I contact regarding toll transactions?
        answer: |
          For assistance regarding toll transactions on or after Nov. 9, 2024, customers should contact HCTRA
          customer service at hctra.org or by calling 281-875-EASY (3279).  TxTag will continue to invoice and
          collect for transactions that occurred on or before Nov. 8, 2024. If you receive a bill from TxTag
          for past due tolls, contact the TxTag Call Center or visit the two Austin-area customer service centers
          to resolve the bill as soon as possible to avoid additional fees and collection notices.
      - question: |
          When will HCTRA begin billing and customer services operations for TxTag?
        answer: |
          HCTRA will begin performing billing and customer service operations for TxTag starting Dec. 2, 2024.
  - context: |
      TxTag accounts will be transitioned to a new HCTRA EZ TAG account.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Do I have to open a new HCTRA account and close my TxTag account?
        answer: |
          You may open a new EZ TAG account at any time. However, if your TxTag account is active and in good
          standing, there is no reason to do so, as the account will automatically transition to HCTRA.
      - question: What will happen to my account balance or prepaid tolls?
        answer: |
          If you have a TxTag account and an existing HCTRA account with matching information, your TxTag
          account will be closed, and the remaining balance refunded. TxTAG will manage all communications
          regarding closures and refunds.
      - question: |
          Will my current TxTag account still work after the transition?
        answer: |
          If your account was active and in good standing (meaning you have had transactions in the last 12
          months and do not have a balance due), then your TxTag account will be transferred to HCTRA.
  - context: |
      Existing TxTag toll transponders and tags will continue to work on all roads
      There is a fee for motorcycle and license plate tags
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Will my current toll transponder or tag continue to work on all roads, or do I have to order a HCTRA tag?
        answer: |
          Yes, your current TxTag will continue to work on all toll roads in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Just make sure it
          is installed in your vehicle, your account details are up to date, and there is enough money in your account for tolls.
          If you need a new or replacement sticker tag after the transition, you will need to order an EZ TAG.
      - question: |
          Will I receive a new toll transponder or equipment after the transition?
        answer: |
          No, you will use your existing tag after the transition. Customers who need a new or replacement tag sticker
          after the transition will have to order an EZ TAG.
      - question: |
          Will the motorcycle and license plate tags have a fee?
        answer: |
          Yes, HCTRA hard case tags have an initial fee of $15 for the first three tags and $10 each thereafter.
